# Day 7: Implementing `VariantList` and Operator Overloading in the `Let` Class

## Learning Objectives

### Implementing `VariantList` in `Let`:
- Learn how to embed the `VariantList` functionality within the `Let` class to manage dynamic lists of `Variant` objects.
- Understand how to overload operators in C++ (specifically `+`) to combine or add multiple `Let` objects.
- Improve the design of the `Let` class to handle collections of `Variant` objects seamlessly.

### Working with Operator Overloading:
- Learn how to overload the `+` operator to concatenate or combine two `Let` objects into a single `Let` object.
- Understand how to extend existing classes to support new functionality like combining lists of different types.

### Working with Initializer Lists:
- Implement and understand the use of initializer lists to pass multiple values of different types to a class.
- Learn how to efficiently add elements to a `VariantList` inside the `Let` class using the `+` operator and initializer lists.

## Task

### 1. **Modify the `Let` Class to Implement `VariantList`**
- Refactor the `Let` class to store a `VariantList` internally.
- Ensure that `Let` can accept a variety of types through the initializer list (e.g., integers, strings, doubles).
- Use `VariantList` to manage the collection of `Variant` objects inside the `Let` class.

### 2. **Implement the `+` Operator for `Let`**
- Overload the `+` operator to concatenate two `Let` objects.
- Ensure that adding a new `Let` object to an existing one appends the `Variant` objects from the second `Let` to the first.
- Ensure that the operator can handle combining elements like integers, strings, and doubles properly.

### 3. **Test the `Let` Class with Examples**
- Test the implementation by creating `Let` objects with various types of `Variant` objects (e.g., integers, strings).
- Add two `Let` objects using the `+` operator and check that the result is as expected.

## Example Usage

```cpp
Let a = {1, 4, "test", "hello"};   // Creating Let object with integers and strings
Let b = a + {6, "world"};          // Adding another Let object

// The result will combine the elements of a and b into a new Let object
