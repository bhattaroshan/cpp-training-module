# Day 8: Extending `LoggingDecorator` and `Let` with Enhanced Features

## Learning Objectives

### Enhancing `LoggingDecorator` Functionality:
- Extend the `LoggingDecorator` class to support operations such as addition and indexing with detailed logging.
- Understand how to use operator overloading to integrate `LoggingDecorator` seamlessly with the `Let` class.
- Learn how to handle nested structures and ensure operations are properly logged for clarity.

### Improving the `Let` Class:
- Enhance the `Let` class to support additional operations, including handling nested `LoggingDecorator` objects.
- Refine the operator overloading mechanisms to provide better compatibility with various types.

### Handling Composite Objects:
- Work with composite objects by combining `LoggingDecorator` instances.
- Test and debug operations to ensure consistent behavior and proper logging.

## Task

### 1. **Enhance the `LoggingDecorator` Class**
- Refactor the `LoggingDecorator` to:
  - Support arithmetic operations between wrapped `Let` objects.
  - Log every operation in detail for better debugging.
  - Provide robust support for nested `LoggingDecorator` objects.

### 2. **Refine the `Let` Class**
- Ensure that `Let` can handle operations with `LoggingDecorator` instances without breaking.
- Expand `Let` functionality to support dynamic type combinations more effectively.

### 3. **Test and Debug**
- Test the enhanced functionality of `LoggingDecorator` and `Let` with examples.
- Validate that all operations are logged correctly and handle edge cases gracefully.

## Example Usage

```cpp
Let a = {1, "hello", 4.5}; // Creating a Let object
Let b = {2, "world", 5.5};

ConsoleLogger logger;
LoggingDecorator loggingLet1(a, logger);
LoggingDecorator loggingLet2(b, logger);

// Combining LoggingDecorator objects
LoggingDecorator result = loggingLet1 + loggingLet2;

// Accessing elements and logging the operations
std::cout << result[1] << std::endl;

// Printing the final result
std::cout << result << std::endl;
