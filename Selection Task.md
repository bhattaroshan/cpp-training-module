# Selection Task: Inventory Management System with Notification System

## Problem Statement

Design and implement an Inventory Management System for a retail organization using the following concepts:

- **Composition** for managing products in the organization.
- **Abstract classes and inheritance** for creating different types of suppliers who will subscribe to the organization for inventory notifications.
- **Notification system** that alerts suppliers when a product's stock level falls below the threshold.

---

## Requirements

### 1. Organization Class (Composition of Products)
- Create an `Organization` class that will hold a collection of `Product` objects using composition (i.e., a vector or list of `Product` objects).
- The `Organization` class should be able to:
  - Add new products to the inventory.
  - Remove products from the inventory.
  - Search for products by `productID` or `productName`.
  - Display the full inventory, including the product name, category, and stock levels.

### 2. Product Class
The `Product` class should include the following attributes:
- `productID` (unique identifier)
- `productName`
- `category`
- `price`
- `stockLevel` (current stock of the product)
- `reorderThreshold` (threshold below which restocking is needed)

It should have methods to:
- Update `stockLevel` when products are sold.
- Check if restocking is necessary (i.e., if `stockLevel` is below `reorderThreshold`).

### 3. Abstract Supplier Class
Define an abstract class `Supplier` with the following:
- An abstract method `notifyRestock(productID, quantity)` that will be called when a product's stock falls below its threshold.
- A method `subscribeToOrganization(organization)` that allows suppliers to subscribe to an `Organization` to receive notifications when products need restocking.

### 4. Concrete Supplier Classes
Implement at least two concrete classes that inherit from the `Supplier` abstract class:
- **LocalSupplier**: A supplier who operates locally and provides immediate restocking.
- **GlobalSupplier**: A supplier who might take longer to restock the product.

Both supplier classes should implement the `notifyRestock()` method to:
- Print a message to the console or simulate an action when a notification is received.

### 5. Restocking Logic in Organization
In the `Organization` class:
- When a productâ€™s `stockLevel` drops below its `reorderThreshold`:
  - Automatically notify all subscribed suppliers (i.e., instances of `Supplier` subclasses).
  - The notification should include the `productID` and the quantity needed to bring the product back to its original stock level.

### 6. Inventory Report
The `Organization` class should include a method to generate an inventory report that provides:
- A list of all products with their `productName`, `category`, `price`, and `stockLevel`.
- A list of products whose `stockLevel` is below the `reorderThreshold` and the quantity that needs to be restocked.

## Example Usage

```python
# Create some products
product1 = Product(101, "Laptop", "Electronics", 1000, 10, 5)
product2 = Product(102, "Smartphone", "Electronics", 500, 3, 5)

# Create the Organization and add products
organization = Organization()
organization.add_product(product1)
organization.add_product(product2)

# Create suppliers
local_supplier = LocalSupplier("Local Supplier")
global_supplier = GlobalSupplier("Global Supplier")

# Suppliers subscribe to the organization
local_supplier.subscribe_to_organization(organization)
global_supplier.subscribe_to_organization(organization)

# Simulate a sale and update stock level
product1.stockLevel = 4  # below threshold, should trigger restocking

# Generate inventory report
organization.generate_report()
