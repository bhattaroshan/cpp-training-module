# Selection Process

The participants were given a task outlined in the document [**Selection Task.md**](https://github.com/bhattaroshan/cpp-training-module/blob/main/Selection%20Task.md) with a time frame of 3 days to complete it. After the submission, each participant was interviewed individually to explain their project and demonstrate their knowledge. Based on this process, the final selection was made.
